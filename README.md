# ai-car
A basic recurrent neural network that attempts to learn to drive a 2D car.

Note: this is very basic. The machine learning is written by me, from scratch
and I know very little about machine learning.

The project is written in JavaScript and designed to run in a browser, using
[p5.js](https://p5js.org/) for graphics (and occasionally vectors).

The result is not very user friendly and often requires small changes to the
code to alter. Some of the code is also not great.
